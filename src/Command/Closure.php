 * A Closure command allows the use of closure in a (composite) command.

 *
 * This provides the flexibility to use custom logic in a command without
 * subclassing a command, while still allowing the use of the command library.
 *
 * eg: $command = new Closure(function() {echo "hello world";});
 * $command->execute();//echoes 'hello world'
